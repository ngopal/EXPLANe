Background

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motor neuron
disease (MND), affecting either upper or lower motor
neurons. Generally patients experience signs and symptoms
of progressive muscle atrophy and weakness, problems with
swallowing, leading to respiratory failure and death. Only
5-10 % of patients survive more than 10 years and median
survival is 3-5 years from onset (1).

In this study, the hypothesis was that whether STH gene
rs62063857 variant could be used as a biomarker to
diferrantiate SALS from Dementia and Parkinson’s Disease.

Saitollin (STH) Rs62063857

Objects

The aim of the study was to determine whether saitohin gene
rs62063 857 variant was associated with sporadic
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SALS).

Methods

We had 597 sporadic ALS patients and 423 controls to
genotype. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood
and a polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment
lenght polymorphism procedure was used to genotype the
STH gene rs62063857 variant (2). The amplified fragment
was digested HinfI restriction endonuclease and run on an
8% polyacrylimide gel followed by silver staining. SPSS
statistical analysis was used in the calculation of genotype
and allele frequencies and association.

Results

Although ALS is a rare disease with a prevalance of 1-2 in
100.000 worldwide, it is a devestating disorder. In our
earlier studies, we found that STH rs62063857 variant was
associated with dementia (3) and Parkinson’s disease. In

this particular study, we did not find any association
between the STH gene rs62063 857 variant and SALS.

Discussion and conclusions

The satiohin gene rs62063857 variant was not associated with
SALS ( )(2= 0.063, P=0.969). The AA, AG and GG genotype
frequencies in the sals were 61.5, 34.0 and 4.5 % in cases and
60.8, 34.5 and 4.7 % in controls respectively. The A and G
allele frequencies were 78.48 and 21.52% in cases and 78.0
and 22.0 % in the controls respectively. There was no
association on genders ( )(2= 0.345, P=0.842 in male and

)(2=l.l13, P=0.573 in female).
